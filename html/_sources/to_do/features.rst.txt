Features
========

- ability to run an small and large problems -> images of deformed 10, 100 and 1000 grain polycrystals (and maybe more)
- ability to deform complex microstructures -> image TA6V (the complexity is more on the microstructure generation from, but still)
- ability to deform different shapes of samples: cubes, cylinders, actual specimens
- ability to apply various boundary conditions: uniaxial, multiaxial, tension, compression, plane strain compression, ...
- ability to run to large strain -> image of a much deformed polycrystal showing the orientation field and the plastic work
- ability to output many results -> image of a deformed polycrystal colored from several meaningful variables

Operation
---------

.. - highlight example jobs packaged with FEPX (include shell scripts for Neper generation, running, post processing - same as with FEPX)
.. - highlight how it works with Neper? Generation / meshing / simulation / results

FEPX contains several example simulations pre-packaged to get you started running simulations. These simulations are small - they are meant to be easily distributed and quickly performed on
a modern laptop computer. Much larger meshes (many more grains, or finer microstructural features) are able to be simulated given more robust computational power - either a computational
workstation or a computational cluster.

The example simulations detailed on this page are also outlined in detail within the documentation. A domain of a 100 grain aggregate with a synthetic microstructure generated via centroidal tessellation is utilized for all examples. Each cell in the tessellation represents a discrete grain in the domain and all grains are volumetrically discretized into finite elements. Below are the commands to generate the tessellation and finite element mesh via `Neper <https://http://www.neper.info/>`_:

Uniaxial Deformation
--------------------

This example covers the uniaxial tensile deformation of a FCC polycrystal by strain targeting to
2% axial strain. Four steps are defined with 2 increments prescribed for each step. Grip boundary
conditions are applied to the sample with the primary loading face set as ‘z1’ loaded in the ‘+Z’
direction.

Multiaxial Deformation with Constant Strain Rate
------------------------------------------------

This example covers the biaxial deformation of a HCP polycrystal at a constant strain rate
followed by unloading. Loads are proportionally applied in the principal stress space as ‘-1:0:1’
for σ 1 :σ 2 :σ 3 , respectively. Strict load tolerance options are prescribed and ‘latent’ hardening
is enabled. The primary loading direction is set to be coincident with the compressive stress
direction or ‘x’ and a strain rate jump is applied on the third step doubling the prescribed
strain rate.

Multiaxial Deformation with Constant Load Rate
----------------------------------------------

This example covers the triaxial deformation of a dual phase FCC/BCC polycrystal at a constant
load rate followed by a dwell episode and subsequent unloading. Loads are proportionally
applied in the principal stress space as ‘-0.375:-0.625:1’ for σ1:σ2:σ3, respectively. Loose
load tolerance options are prescribed and ‘cyclic’ hardening is enabled with generic values.
The primary loading direction is set to be coincident with the tensile stress direction or ‘z’
and a dwell episode is initiated on the third step for 500 seconds.

Restarting a Simulation
-----------------------

A typical use case for the restart capabilities are to append additional loading steps to a completed simulation or to add additional loading cycles to a deformed sample. This example covers
the triaxial deformation of a FCC polycrystal at a constant strain rate followed by unloading.
Loads are proportionally applied in the principal stress space as ‘0:0:1’ for σ1:σ2:σ3 , respectively. Strict load tolerance options are prescribed and ‘restart’ is enabled in the second cycle
directory. The primary loading direction is set to be coincident with the tensile stress direction
or ‘z’.

Running a Simulation with External File Reading
-----------------------------------------------

Certain simulation input may be input from external files in order to allow for a static configuration and mesh file to be used for multiple simulations while certain microstructure information is varied. This example covers the uniaxial tension/compression deformation of a dual phase
FCC/BCC polycrystal by load targeting to +/- 500 [N]. Three steps are defined with a standard
time-step value of 0.05 [s] and a minimum time-step value of 0.0001 [s]. Minimal boundary
conditions are applied to the sample with the primary loading face set as ‘x1’ loaded in the ‘+X’
direction. Elemental orientations and grain/phase assignments are read in from the external
files simulation.ori and simulation.phase, respectively.
